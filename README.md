## NOTE: This plugin is considered dead.
**Earlier versions of WorldEdit would crash on anything but trivial copy/move jobs, SlowEdit was created in order to copy one specific project and needs a LOT of work in order to be of any real use.**

# SlowEdit
Background processing of massive copy and transform jobs
